While working on a virtual file system, I ran into the usual limits of patterns like Strategy and Facade, great on paper, but awkward when you need real runtime modularity.

So I came up with something I call the **Reflector Pattern**.

---

### Core idea:
- Each entity (or facade) implements the same interfaces as its handlers  
- Handlers contain all the data and logic, and implement those same interfaces  
- The facade “reflects” the interfaces, overriding the methods and delegating them directly to the handlers  
- Handlers can be swapped at runtime (hot-swap) without breaking the facade or client code  
- Each handler does one thing well, full SOLID compliance  

---

### Why it works:
The client only talks to interfaces.  
The entity doesn’t “own” logic or data, it just mirrors the API and routes calls dynamically.  
This gives you total modularity, polymorphism, and clean decoupling.

It’s like a **Facade + Strategy**, but where the Facade actually implements the same interfaces as its strategies, becoming a “Reflector” of their behavior.

Also, unlike Composition over inheritance that lets you reuse behavior but still exposes internal components to the consumer. Reflector Pattern “reflects” the interfaces, so the entity is a true polymorphic proxy to its handlers, hiding the implementation entirely and allowing seamless runtime swapping.

In the end, it’s essentially a design that takes a different approach, even though its underlying implementation still shares many similarities with Composition over Inheritance.

---

### Here’s an example:

```java
// Code by unrays - Reflector Pattern

// Handlers (strategies)
class WalkHandler implements IMove { move() -> print("Walking") }
class SwordAttackHandler implements IAttack { attack() -> print("Swing sword") }

// Facade entity implements same interfaces
class GameCharacter implements IMove, IAttack {
    moveHandler: IMove
    attackHandler: IAttack

    move() -> moveHandler.move()
    attack() -> attackHandler.attack()
}

// Usage
hero = new GameCharacter()
hero.moveHandler = new WalkHandler()
hero.attackHandler = new SwordAttackHandler()

consumer.use(hero)  // Only sees IMove & IAttack interface
hero.move()         // Walking
hero.attack()       // Swing sword

// Hot-swap at runtime
hero.moveHandler = new RunHandler()
hero.move()         // Running

```

---

I haven’t come across a pattern that matches this exactly. Has anyone seen something similar, or could this be a new approach?
I’d also love some feedback on this approach, it might be flawed, but I think it could be useful in certain situations.  
I’m here to learn and to iterate on this thought, so be respectful in the comments :)
