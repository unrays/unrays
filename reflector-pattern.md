While working on a virtual file system, I ran into the usual limits of patterns like Strategy and Facade, great on paper, but awkward when you need real runtime modularity.

So I came up with something I call the **Reflector Pattern**.

---

### Core idea:
- Every entity (or facade) implements the same interfaces as its **handlers**.  
- **Handlers** contain all the logic and data, and implement the same interfaces.  
- The entity (or “reflector”) **mirrors** these interfaces, overriding methods and delegating calls directly to its handlers.  
- Handlers can be **hot-swapped at runtime** without breaking the entity or client code.  
- Each handler follows **SOLID principles** and focuses on a single responsibility. 

---

### Why it works:
The client only talks to interfaces.  
The entity doesn’t “own” logic or data, it just mirrors the API and routes calls dynamically.  
This gives you total modularity, polymorphism, and clean decoupling.

It’s like a **Facade + Strategy**, but where the Facade actually implements the same interfaces as its strategies, becoming a true **Reflector** of their behavior.


Unlike typical **composition-over-inheritance**, which exposes internal components to clients, the Reflector **hides implementation entirely** while providing polymorphic behavior.  

> Essentially, it’s a modified **Delegate Pattern**: instead of a single delegate, the entity can delegate multiple responsibilities dynamically, while keeping its API clean and fully polymorphic.

### Here’s an example: (Corrected example, the last one was misleading and incorrect)

```java
// Code by unrays - Reflector Pattern

// Interfaces for file operations
interface IReadable { void read(); }
interface IWritable { void write(String data); }
interface IDeletable { void delete(); }

// Handlers: single responsibility
class FileReadHandler implements IReadable {
    @Override
    public void read() { System.out.println("Reading file contents"); }
}

class FileWriteHandler implements IWritable {
    @Override
    public void write(String data) { System.out.println("Writing data: " + data); }
}

class FileDeleteHandler implements IDeletable {
    @Override
    public void delete() { System.out.println("Deleting file"); }
}

// Reflector: Entity that reflects multiple interfaces
class FileEntity implements IReadable, IWritable, IDeletable {
    IReadable readHandler;
    IWritable writeHandler;
    IDeletable deleteHandler;

    @Override
    public void read() { readHandler.read(); }
    @Override
    public void write(String data) { writeHandler.write(data); }
    @Override
    public void delete() { deleteHandler.delete(); }
}

// Client code sees only the interfaces
class FileManager {
    void operate(IReadable reader, IWritable writer, IDeletable deleter) {
        reader.read();
        writer.write("Hello World");
        deleter.delete();
    }
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FileEntity myFile = new FileEntity();

        // Assign handlers dynamically
        myFile.readHandler = new FileReadHandler();
        myFile.writeHandler = new FileWriteHandler();
        myFile.deleteHandler = new FileDeleteHandler();

        FileManager manager = new FileManager();
        manager.operate(myFile, myFile, myFile);
        // Output: Reading file contents
        //         Writing data: Hello World
        //         Deleting file

        // Hot-swap handlers at runtime
        myFile.readHandler = () -> System.out.println("Reading cached contents");
        myFile.writeHandler = (data) -> System.out.println("Logging write: " + data);
        myFile.deleteHandler = () -> System.out.println("Archiving file instead of deleting");

        manager.operate(myFile, myFile, myFile);
        // Output: Reading cached contents
        //         Logging write: Hello World
        //         Archiving file instead of deleting
    }
}

```

### Key takeaways
- **Reflector Pattern** enables runtime modularity and polymorphism in a robust, flexible way.  
- Each handler focuses on a single responsibility, fully compliant with **SOLID principles**.  
- The entity acts as a **polymorphic proxy**, completely hiding implementation details.  
- Built on the **Delegate Pattern**, it supports multiple dynamic delegates transparently.  
- This pattern provides a clear approach for highly modular systems requiring runtime flexibility.  
- Feedback, improvements, or references to similar patterns are welcome.
