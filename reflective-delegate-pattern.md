So when I was coding, I wanted a simpler, more organized way to handle responsibilities and make the **contract between components** clearer. Patterns like **Strategy** or **Facade** work fine in theory, but trying to manage multiple responsibilities often felt **messy and fragile**.  

That’s when I started experimenting with what I now call the **Reflective Delegate Pattern**. After reading feedback and thinking back on my previous post, I consider this a **definitive version** of the idea.  

It’s a bit **philosophical and experimental**, and not always easy to show clearly in code. Some strict **SOLID** advocates might disagree, but I find it a helpful way to think about **modularity**, **responsibility management**, and **runtime organization** in a slightly unconventional way.  

I call this approach the **Reflective Delegate Pattern**.

### Core idea    
- Each entity (or facade) implements the same interfaces that its **delegates** provide.  
- **Delegates** encapsulate all logic and data, adhering to these interfaces.   
- The entity basically acts as a **mirror**, forwarding calls directly to its delegates.      
- Delegates can be **swapped at runtime** without breaking the entity or client code.  
- Each delegate maintains a **single responsibility**, following **SOLID principles** wherever possible.

### Why it works
Cliients only interact with the **interfaces**, never directly with the logic.  
The entity itself doesn’t “own” the logic or data; it simply **mirrors the API** and forwards calls to its delegates.      
This provides **modularity**, **polymorphism**, and **clean decoupling**.     

It’s like a **Facade + Strategy**, but here the Facade implements the same interfaces as its delegates, effectively **reflecting their behavior**.    

> Essentially, it’s a **specialized form of the Delegate Pattern**: instead of a single delegate, the entity can handle multiple responsibilities dynamically, while keeping its API clean and fully polymorphic.

### Here’s an example:

```java
Reflective Delegate Pattern
https://github.com/unrays

// Interfaces
interface IPrintable { void print(String msg); }
interface ISavable { void save(String msg); }

// Delegates 
class Printer implements IPrintable { 
    @Override public void print(String msg) { System.out.println("Printing: " + msg); }
}

class Saver implements ISavable {
     @Override public void save(String msg) { System.out.println("Saving: " + msg); } 
}
 
// Entity reflecting multiple interfaces
class DocumentService implements IPrintable, ISavable {    
    IPrintable printDelegate;
    ISavable saveDelegate;

    @Override public void print(String msg) { printDelegate.print(msg); }
    @Override public void save(String msg) { saveDelegate.save(msg); }  
}

// Usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DocumentService docService = new DocumentService();

        docService.printDelegate = new Printer();
        docService.saveDelegate = new Saver();

        docService.print("Project Plan");
        docService.save("Project Plan");

        docService.printDelegate = (msg) -> System.out.println("Mock printing: " + msg);
        docService.print("Test Document");
    }
}
```

### Key takeaways
- The **Reflective Delegate Pattern** enables flexible runtime modularity and polymorphism.   
- Each delegate handles a **single responsibility**, keeping components clean and focused.  
- The entity acts as a **polymorphic proxy**, fully hiding implementation details.   
- Based on the **Delegate Pattern**, it supports multiple dynamic delegates transparently.  
- Provides a clear approach for **modular systems** that require runtime flexibility.  
- Feedback, improvements, or references to similar patterns are welcome.
