## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm **Félix**, 19, studying *Computer Science* at Cégep de Rimouski (DEC-BAC) while mostly **self-taught**.  
I spend **4–8 hours a day coding**, learning through projects, experimentation, and exploration.

I've had over **11 years of piano experience**, including several years at the conservatory, and I studied classical music in depth. I have a strong passion for **baroque music**, especially JS Bach.


I started programming in **September 2023**, diving into **C++** and gradually exploring more advanced techniques. I began experimenting with **ECS engines in mid-October 2025** and **compile-time C++ techniques (TMP, CRTP, etc.) in mid-November 2025**, and I've been exploring them ever since.

I've been exploring **PC hardware since 2019**, building and optimizing rigs, experimenting with **overclocking, benchmarking, and custom cooling solutions**, and doing **personal case modding** to push both performance and aesthetics.  

I like looking under the hood of systems, figuring out how they **work**, and seeing if I can make them better.<br/>
I have a dream I’m working toward, and I’ll do everything I can to make it **happen**.
